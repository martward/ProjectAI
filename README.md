# ProjectAI

To run the code:

- Ensure the PC and the phone are on the same network
- Connect the phone to the PC
- Open up the android project in android studio
- Change the IP to the IP of the PC (MainActivity.java at the top)
- Open the visualisation.py and run it
- Run the app on the phone

You will see two figures, one containing 4 points representing the corners of the phone, 
the other shows six line plots which are the translation values in the x, y and z axes and 
the accelerometer values in the x, y and z values.
